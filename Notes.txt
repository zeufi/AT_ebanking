The project have 2 branches:
 - staging which is my default and protected branch used for tests in staging environment
 - master which is used for tests in production environment.
Because tests run in prod usually not contains all tests run in staging.
In the master branch our all TestNG.xml files will contain only the tests enabled to run
on prod environment and vice versa in the staging branch our all TestNG.xml files will
contain only the tests enabled to run on staging environment.
